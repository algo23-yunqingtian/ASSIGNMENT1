# ASSIGNMENT1
this project is Based on the strategy of report replication, and after testing, in order to ensure a more robust yield, I have carefully added the conditions of stop profit and stop loss, so as to ensure that profits are not taken back when necessary. This package requires additional installation of PIP.
I think the 580 day backtesting estimation period and 95 day predicted backtesting period for stock index futures in the report are very interesting. I should have re estimated the backtesting estimation period and duration, but my computing power does not support it. After all, nearly 10 years ago, the trend and style of stock index futures may also have changed, so necessary adjustments are necessary.
I think the most valuable content in this report is how to use the support vector machine tool for machine learning, which has given me a little understanding and understanding in machine learning and is also the foundation for my future improvement and optimization. I am very grateful for the opportunity given by this assignment, as well as for the teacher who encouraged me and my hardworking self.
